The app has been developed using [Koltin](https://kotlinlang.org/) a modern programmer friendly language primarily used for Android Development. It was decided to create the app using Kotlin due to many helper features such as variable interpolation, higher-order functions and null safety. As Kotlin is compiled to JVM byte-code it is also 100% inter opterable with Java! [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) 3.1.2 was used throughout development.
